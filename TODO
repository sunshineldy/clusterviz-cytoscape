TODO:
1. Clean up existing source codes (variable, function and class naming, structure of classes and so on)

2. Add basic topological analysis to the right-click menu of each identified cluster.

3. Batch GO enrichment analysis for all identified clusters.

4. Update GO terms and annotation file online.

5. Add MCL, k-means clustering algorithms.
	5.1 refactor the algorithm and AnalyzeAction classes (Gang is working on this)
	5.2 Add new algorithm

6. Add a nested-network based visual style for clustering result.
