This software is released under LGPL license.

1. Introduction

ClusterViz is a Cytoscape plug-in for analysis and visualization of clusters
from network. Based on another Cytoscape plug-in named MCODE, three different
graph clustering algorithms (IPCA, EAGLE and MCODE) were implemented in
ClusterViz.  This plug-in is developed by Juan Cai and Gang Chen, and supported
by Prof.  Jianxin Wang and Dr. Min Li, from Central South University.This
project is supported by graduate student creative funding of HuNan, China, NO.
CX2009B040.

2. Quick Start

Following is a short quick start for the usage of ClusterViz, detailed
information of the algorithms implemented in this plug-in can be found in
related papers.
	1. Install Cytoscape: Download and install latest Cytoscape 2.7.0 (www.cytoscape.org).
	2. Install ClusterViz: 1)Download the Jar version of ClusterViz from our
website, and then move it to the plug-in directory of Cytoscape; 2) Install
ClusterViz using plug-in manager of Cytoscape.
	3. Clustering Analysis: Start Cytoscape, and click plugin->ClusterViz->Start
to start ClusterViz. Choose clustering algorithm and set parameters, then click
Analyze button. Clustering results will be displayed on the right panel.
	4. GO Enrichment Analysis: right-click on the interested identified cluster,
click "GO Enrichment Analysis on Cluster XX" to active the setting panel of GO
enrichment analysis. Click run BiNGO button to perform GO enrichment analysis.
Results are provided as a table and a colorful graph.
