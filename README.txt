1. Introduction
ClusterViz is a Cytoscape plug-in for analysis and visualization of clusters from
network. Based on another Cytoscape plug-in named MCODE, three different graph
clustering algorithms (IPCA, EAGLE and MCODE) were implemented in ClusterViz.
This plug-in is developed by Juan Cai and Gang Chen, and supported by Prof.
Jianxin Wang and Dr. Min Li, from Central South University.
